# Omega Core – Visualization UI

⚠️ NON-CANONICAL LAYER ⚠️

This UI is a **read-only visualization** of Omega Core.
It does not:
- enforce invariants
- make decisions
- verify evidence
- produce canonical state

All authority lives in `omega_core/`.

If this UI disagrees with the kernel, the UI is wrong.
